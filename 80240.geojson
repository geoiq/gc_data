Beer selection leaves a bit to be desired, but it is a comedy club and they do go beyond just your standard macro selections so I can't complain. They also have the same drink service once you're inside the theater area as well.\n\nThe acts that ACME pulls in can vary pretty significantly and some nights will be better than others, but I've never come close to feeling I haven't gotten my money's worth. Speaking of getting your money's worth - join their Insider list for two free tickets a month or find an unsuspecting friend that has a birthday each month (as well as 4 other friends) and you can get in free. Also, for you college folks (or those still pretending to be in college), put down the beer bong or skip the toga party, grab your college ID, head to ACME and you get in for $5 almost all nights (I think there is an exception for one show on Friday and not valid Saturday) - it'll be an enjoyable night you'll actually remember.\n\nThe rotation usually goes as follows: ACME emcee/opening act (hit or miss), featured act (usually a seasoned local comedy vet) followed by the headliner (check their website - usually rope in a couple of good national acts each month).\n\nHecklers and bachelorette parties should head to Drink, Spin, Barfly or somewhere else where your annoying behavior is more likely to be tolerated.","id":"a6hdsizm7r47"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2750269999401,44.9897169997464]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ballet of the Dolls","description":"Ballet of the Dolls\n345 13th Ave NE, Minneapolis\nhttp://www.ritzdolls.com/\n$25-30\n\nFrom Yelp.com\nSultry, campy, and entertaining dance/theater performances.  \"The Dolls\", as they are affectionately called, are currently residing at the Ritz Theater in NE Minneapolis.

The actors are divided into two teams, and they challenge each other to different improv challenges and get scored on it, like a sport. I love improv because it truly reveals a comedian's mad hat skills, and it calls for great audience participation.

Five productions comprise the opera house's season, with the first in late September, and the last running through April and May.  \n\nDale Johnson, the Minnesota Opera's Artistic Director, has won some acclaim nationally for the opera house's eclectic programming. While the season typically features two beloved warhorses--such as La Bohème or Carmen--the remaining three productions explore obscure, lesser known works from the bel canto repertoire (a 19th century sub-genre that celebrates ornate singing and vocal agility), as well as works by contemporary American masters over the last three decades.\n\nIn offering such a diverse program, the Minnesota Opera seems keen on pleasing multiple audiences:  the opera aficionado, for whom the charms of bel canto are likeliest to appeal, and the novice, likely to be seduced by Puccini, Verdi or Mozart. Contemporary works (such as last year's much hyped staging of Pinocchio) are a hit or miss; musically they tend to lack traits many of us adore about opera, such as histrionic plots, showstopping arias and gorgeous period costumes. At the same time, contemporary pieces are crafted with a sense of realism often lacking in operatic standards (the incestuous Wagnerian storylines reach great heights of sublime absurdity).\n\nAudiences at a Minnesota Opera production resemble those at other local classical music events: older (55 seems to be the median age), White and wealthy. Still, a small cadre of younger opera queens and students of voice are always present, offering us a glimmer of hope that refined musical tastes can survive in an age of Miley Cyrus and American Idol. Sartorially, Minnesota Opera goers are comparatively informal; business wear and cocktail dresses are the norm, rather than the suits and gowns often seen at the elite opera houses, such as the Met or Lyric Opera. The occasional khaki or jean-wearing buffoon makes an appearance, but this is Minnesota, after all.\n\nIn terms of seating, first row balcony boxes are the best (and priciest), and the first 10 or so rows on the main floor are the worst, acoustically and physically (you'll have to stretch your head and neck up to read the translated libretto above the stage).
