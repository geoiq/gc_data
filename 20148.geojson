The house that we stayed at just 2 weeks ago is completely leveled and some of the people that stayed in the same guest house as us have died. The good news is that the orphanage that we worked in is still standing and the babies are all safe.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe chaos wrought in the desperately poor country of Haiti is hard to fathom, even as we watch it unfold on our TV screens and laptops. It’s destruction on a colossal scale.&lt;br /&gt;\nYet the world is not standing idly by. President Barack Obama promised an all-out rescue and humanitarian effort, including a 2,000-member Marine unit. “We have to be there for them in their hour of need,” the president said.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe United Nations released $10 million in emergency funds. Canada pledged $4.8 million. The Irish telecommunications company Digicel donated $5 million in aid and to repair the country’s damaged phone network. And there have been many, many more. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe American Red Cross has ushered in an outpouring of donations large and small, including countless $10 pledges sent via text message. The $10 text pledges alone — a Red Cross initiative backed by the U.S. State Department — banked nearly $1 million by the end of Wednesday. For onlookers with heavy hearts, such texts are a hedge against helplessness. And they’re a symbol to the millions of suffering Haitians that we’re aware of their needs. And we care.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStats provided by MPNnow.com&lt;/p&gt;","link:enclosure (image/jpeg)":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4274988856_bc2ecbed92_m.jpg","updated":{"end_time":"2010/01/14 15:05:21 -0500","original":"Thu Jan 14 20:05:20 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/14 15:05:20 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.343101,18.54298]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajax8055/4305113477/","title":"play time","published":{"end_time":"2010/01/25 23:34:56 -0500","original":"Tue Jan 26 04:34:55 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/25 23:34:55 -0500"},"id":"117","link:license (text/html)":null,"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/ajax8055/\"&gt;ajax8055&lt;/a&gt;

There, on desks made from scrap lumber, several teens were teaching eachother vector calculus (that's Calc III).  They have no calculus teacher, and are able to do this because they found a textbook in a donation pile.  This picture was not posed, and they didn't know we were coming, this was a totally random interaction.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI'm putting together a laptop to send back to them loaded with learning materials from MIT's OpenCourseWare and other sources.

The lawless Cite Soleil is regarded by many as one of the most dangerous places on earth. It was developed as a shanty town. Most of its estimated 200,000 to 400,000 residents live in extreme poverty.[1] The area is generally regarded as one of the poorest and most dangerous areas of the Western Hemisphere's poorest country; it is one of the biggest slums in the Northern Hemisphere. There is little to no police presence, no sewers, no stores, and little to no electricity.[2]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe neighborhood, originally designed to house manual laborers for a local Export Processing Zone (EPZ), quickly became home to squatters from around the countryside looking for work in the newly constructed factories. After a 1991 coup d'état deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a boycott of Haitian products closed the EPZ.[3] Cité Soleil was soon thrust into extreme poverty and persistent unemployment, with high rates of illiteracy.[2]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nArmed gangs roam the streets. Murder, rape, kidnapping, looting, and shootings are common as every few blocks is controlled by one of more than 30 armed factions.[4] The area has been called a &amp;quot;microcosm of all the ills in Haitian society: endemic unemployment, illiteracy, non-existent public services, insanitary conditions, rampant crime and armed violence&amp;quot;.[5]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it took nearly two weeks for relief aid to arrive in Cité-Soleil.[6] Although the US military have willingly accepted their new role, their relief efforts have been criticized by some as insufficient.[7]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;","link:enclosure (image/jpeg)":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4768687556_3a5c1907f6_o.jpg","updated":{"end_time":"2010/07/06 13:46:00 -0400","original":"Tue Jul 06 17:45:59 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/06 13:45:59 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.334177,18.586343]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oxfam/4327408289/","title":"Cleaning up: Oxfam's cash-for-work program, Haiti","published":{"end_time":"2010/02/03 10:44:38 -0500","original":"Wed Feb 03 15:44:37 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/02/03 10:44:37 -0500"},"link:license (text/html)":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed.en","id":"661","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/oxfam/\"&gt;oxfam international&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oxfam/4327408289/\" title=\"Cleaning up: Oxfam's cash-for-work program, Haiti\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4327408289_6c90b3c1bd_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Cleaning up: Oxfam's cash-for-work program, Haiti\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Residents are cleaning up the camp on the Petionville golf course in Port-au-Prince, Haiti as part of Oxfam's cash-for-work program.

The agency has sent emergency team members specializing in protection, logistics, registration and profiling to assist with the humanitarian effort.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nShelter material was rapidly dispatched to support around 100,000 beneficiaries. In neighbouring Dominican Republic, UNHCR was asked to lead the protection response, deploying an emergency team to work with the Dominican authorities to help Haitians evacuated there.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;quot;UNHCR has conducted assessments to identify the needs of those displaced outside of Port-au-Prince and recognized camps,&amp;quot; Melissa Fleming, the agency's chief spokesperson, told journalists in Geneva. &amp;quot;With this new appeal, UNHCR is aiming to further assist the population living outside camps, thus preventing further displacement or premature return before appropriate and safe conditions are established,&amp;quot; she added.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDuring the course of this year, UNHCR and its partners hope to implement 85 quick impact projects that will target quake-displaced people who have received a lower level of humanitarian assistance than the population living in camps and in the capital, Port-au-Prince.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTwenty-five of these projects will focus on the displaced population living near the border with Dominican Republic. In addition, UNHCR will aim to support Haiti with aid for 60,000 displaced people in the border region and the West, Central and Artibonite areas.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;quot;UNHCR will continue to support the return to Haiti of patients discharged from hospitals in the Dominican Republic and will assist vulnerable individuals who need to remain. In Santo Domingo, support will be given to churches, host families and shelters that are caring for discharged patients and vulnerable Haitians, including unaccompanied children, orphans, women at risk and the disabled,&amp;quot; Fleming said.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN refugee agency and its partners will also support vulnerable third-country nationals, including refugees and undocumented migrants, who were living in Haiti at the time of the earthquake and who either fled to neighbouring Dominican Republic or became displaced in Haiti. In addition to short term humanitarian assistance, they will be offered counselling about voluntary return to their home countries or alternative durable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;","link:enclosure (image/jpeg)":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4520364926_9258d6f069_m.jpg","updated":{"end_time":"2010/04/14 04:19:05 -0400","original":"Wed Apr 14 08:19:04 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/04/14 04:19:04 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.343425,18.55302]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefbelgium/4292165065/","title":"Haiti 2010 Unaccompanied children","published":{"end_time":"2010/01/21 05:48:41 -0500","original":"Thu Jan 21 10:48:40 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/21 05:48:40 -0500"},"id":"913","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/unicefbelgium/\"&gt;UNICEF Belgium&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefbelgium/4292165065/\" title=\"Haiti 2010 Unaccompanied children\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2722/4292165065_271b8a6187_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Haiti 2010 Unaccompanied children\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caption to come. &lt;br /&gt;\nPhotographer's caption: Port-au-Prince, 19/01/2010&lt;br /&gt;\nAn unaccompanied child who is currently in the field hospital set up in the Minustah log base,&lt;br /&gt;\n will move to a home run by CAD a haitian NGO with the help and monitoring of Unicef.&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was deemed necessary to move all unaccompanied children together, as they have created some bonds, but not all children are well enough to move yet.&lt;br /&gt;\nPort-au-Prince, 19/01/2010&lt;br /&gt;\nHelp UNICEF. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.unicef.be/urgencehaiti\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;www.unicef.be/urgencehaiti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.unicef.be/noodhulphaiti\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;www.unicef.be/noodhulphaiti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","link:enclosure (image/jpeg)":"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2722/4292165065_d760cb2fd4_o.jpg","updated":{"end_time":"2010/01/21 05:48:41 -0500","original":"Thu Jan 21 10:48:40 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/21 05:48:40 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.343101,18.54298]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefbelgium/4292165919/","title":"Haiti 2010: water delivered to orphenages","published":{"end_time":"2010/01/21 05:49:27 -0500","original":"Thu Jan 21 10:49:26 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/21 05:49:26 -0500"},"id":"914","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/unicefbelgium/\"&gt;UNICEF Belgium&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefbelgium/4292165919/\" title=\"Haiti 2010: water delivered to orphenages\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4292165919_99b1ff4372_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Haiti 2010: water delivered to orphenages\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caption to come. &lt;br /&gt;\nPhotographer's caption: Port-au-Prince, 19/01/2010&lt;br /&gt;\nUnicef delivers 720 litres of water to an orphanage in the Tabarre section of Port au Prince.
