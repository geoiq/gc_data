The boys' interest in reading picked up after she brought in books that were more interesting to the boys. With more reading came stronger writing skills. The most recent available test scores show a huge improvement. In science, 83.7% of 4th graders passed Ohio's proficiency test, compared with a pass rate of just 35.6% when the school was coed.

The success of this elementary school clearly inspired Toledo Superintendent Eugene Sanders. When he became CEO of Cleveland Public Schools in 2007, one of his first actions was to establish FOUR single-sex public schools in Cleveland -- two on the East Side, two on the West Side -- opening in the fall of 2007.

Most of those schools are COED schools which offer single-sex CLASSROOMS, but which retain at least some coed activities. \nIn some cases, the only coed activities are lunch and one or two electives, so the distinction between a single-sex school, and a coed school with single-sex classrooms, can become a semantic quibble. From March 2002 through July 2007, we tried to make a distinction between single-sex schools, on the one hand, and coed schools with single-sex classes, on the other hand. We listed single-sex schools on one web page, while coed schools with single-sex classes were listed on a separate web page. As it became increasingly obvious that the distinction was often arbitrary, we decided in August 2007 to begin listing all public schools offering single-sex classrooms on the same web page, which is this page.\nBy our count, 97 of the 392 schools below qualify as single-sex schools, meaning that students attending any of those 97 schools have all their school activities -- including lunch and all electives -- in a setting which is all-boys or all-girls. Most of those 97 schools are single-sex campuses, such as the The Ann Richards School for Young Women which opened in Austin, Texas in August 2007. \nNote: Schools which offer single-sex classes only in physical education and/or health and/or sex education are NOT listed here.
