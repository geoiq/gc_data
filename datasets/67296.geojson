During a cross country adventure from New York City to San Francisco, I originally was ending my Route 66 journey in Missouri and then taking the Oregon Trail the rest of the way across the country, but was convinced to at least do the 7 (or maybe 9) mile stretch of 66 in Kansas and check out one town in OK. Well I did that and the extra time helped me to decide to keep going to the end. Best. Decision.

The bridge is a single-span concrete Marsh arch bridge and is the sole surviving bridge of this type on the entire length of the former highway. Two other Marsh arch bridges were also located on US 66 in Kansas, both over the Spring River. It was built in 1923.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe bridge has often been covered with graffiti, but was recently re-painted white. The bridge has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places (as the Brush Creek Bridge) on March 10, 1983, due to its connection with Route 66 and is also a Kansas state landmark.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe bridge is fairly narrow, and due to traffic on the road, a replacement bridge has been built. The road curves toward the new bridge toward Baxter Springs, but a short, one-way road carries traffic to the Rainbow Bridge, which may still be crossed. This was part of a compromise after a disagreement between the county and the Kansas Route 66 Association as federal funds used for construction of the new bridge required demolition of the old. The bridge had been listed with the National Register, which prohibited condemnation of the old bridge.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n.    .    .    .   .    .    .   .    .    .    .   .    .    .    .   .    .    .   .    .    .    .   .    .    .    .   .    .    .   .    .    .    .   &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greggoodman/sets/72157624010055432\"&gt;Route 66 Emblems&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;- - - a flickr set of all of the emblems I found on Route 66&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo read more about Route 66, see more photos and read what it's like driving The Mother Road, be sure to visit &lt;a href=\"http://www.adventuresofagoodman.com/blog/tag/route-66/\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Adventures of a GoodMan on Route 66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greggoodman/4773214985/","id":"12"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.739531,37.074367]}},{"properties":{"title":"blushing leaves 6271","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/4822973595","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/24 06:42:20 -0400","original":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 03:42:19 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/24 06:42:19 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/raysunshine_15205/\"&gt;raysunshine_15205&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/raysunshine_15205/4822973595/\" title=\"blushing leaves 6271\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4822973595_93f6787b5e_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"192\" alt=\"blushing leaves 6271\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/raysunshine_15205/4822973595/","id":"13"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.088639,40.439461]}},{"properties":{"title":"Profile","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/4880103088","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/10 15:03:12 -0400","original":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 12:03:11 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/08/10 15:03:11 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/40696244@N03/\"&gt;Olesya A.

The golden light was too great to resist - it really helped accentuate the color on (and off) the trees. Facing southeast, the tip of The Balmoral can be seen just peeking out near the left base of the monument.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAnother effect using tilt. Shift used to correct perspective and create a three-image vertical stitch (later significantly cropped to my liking, resulting in a 5461 x 5863 final image). Full tilt used to highlight my subject. Again, please leave constructive criticism regarding the use of this effect.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5D II + TSE 24L II + Hoya CPL&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor high-resolution, right-click on image &amp;amp; select Original.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.kennymccartney.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;www.kennymccartney.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ken2000ac/5073141838/","id":"23"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.193754,55.95441]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5077286264","title":"Fall Canopy","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/12 22:32:58 -0400","original":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 19:32:57 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/10/12 22:32:57 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/33398879@N00/\"&gt;Pixilista&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/33398879@N00/5077286264/\" title=\"Fall Canopy\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/5077286264_7268b8bfb9_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" alt=\"Fall Canopy\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skyline Drive, Shenandoah National Park.&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/33398879@N00/5077286264/","id":"24"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.262374,38.758651]}},{"properties":{"title":"An Edit","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5079351305","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/13 20:34:33 -0400","original":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 17:34:32 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/10/13 20:34:32 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/lightwerk/\"&gt;lightwerk&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lightwerk/5079351305/\" title=\"An Edit\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5079351305_661216b942_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"179\" alt=\"An Edit\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn't spend much time with this image the first go around.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI really didn't spend much time with it this time around either, but it's gotten to a better place.&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lightwerk/5079351305/","id":"25"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.362834,38.580833]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5085757867","title":"Minnewaska State Park --  view from Gertude's Nose Trail, October 15, 2010","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/16 08:44:11 -0400","original":"Sat, 16 Oct 2010 05:44:10 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/10/16 08:44:10 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/katysilbs/\"&gt;Katy Silberger&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katysilbs/5085757867/\" title=\"Minnewaska State Park --  view from Gertude's Nose Trail, October 15, 2010\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5085757867_afd77bce0d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"171\" alt=\"Minnewaska State Park --  view from Gertude's Nose Trail, October 15, 2010\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wind was quite strong on this day.
