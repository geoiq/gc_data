growth rate (%)2008The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.<b> Population growth rate (%)</b>1Maldives5.566.........<b>125</b><b>Canada</b><b>0.83</b>.........202Montenegro-0.925 •
