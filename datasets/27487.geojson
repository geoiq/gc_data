In their early years, they boasted that their Lacuna Towers were \"the tallest buildings east of the LA River and west of the Pomona Valley.\"  They were technically incorrect because building heights include the radio antennas on top, and others had them, but at 18 stories, it was very tall and nobody disputed it.  In 1975, crosstown civic rivals, The City of Industry, attempted to steal away the \"tallest building\" title with their Turnbull Tower, which was 19 stories tall.  Commerce retaliated by quietly erecting a 40 foot-tall radio tower on the Lacuna, and hired a Berlin artist to attach illuminated plastic hologram panels to it, so it would resemble a solid, lit structure.  They just as quietly stopped mentioning the \"tallest building\" title when high winds knocked the tower down, into the adjacent electric substation, causing a small fire that cut power to the entire city.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6u15qrl7fkj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.15247,33.99518]}},{"properties":{"name":"ABC Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://riceball.com\" href=\"http://riceball.com\">Wildgift</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> This is a post-club nightspot for Asian American kids.

The soil was rich with the loam from the meandering river, and the garden flourished, eventually occupying both county property and part of a private ranch.  Because he did all his gardening at night, the property owners were scarcely aware what was going on.  By 1927, the gardens were over eight acres of wildflowers, young saplings, and squash vines.  A pond had developed, and in it lived a strange fish that glowed in the dark.  Shortly after the stock market crash of 1929, Bell passed on due to poor health and lack of work, but his garden grew wild, and expanded itself.  It wasn\\'t until the Great Depression, when itinerant \"okie\" workers on the rails were looking for places to camp out, that the garden was discovered.  Rather, they discovered it, but kept it a secret, to keep the vegetables for themselves.  One of the migrant workers, coincidentally named Bell as well,l was entrepreneurial, and gathered up the vegetables and opened a roadside stand.  The vegetables were good, and the stand did well through the Depression.  WW2 came, and the owner used his social standing to coordinate Victory Gardens for the war effort.  After the war, he resumed his grocery business, but quickly shifted strategy to become one of the first supermarkets in Southern California.  (By this time, of course, the gardens were no longer occupied, but still grew many vegetables wild.)  Having amassed great wealth, Bell purchased the old garden area, both the county and ranch portion.  He took the ranch portion and subdivided it into 1/4 acre lots, for suburban development.  Then, he took the remainder and converted it into a small 9-hole golf-course.  A decade later, he bribed three members of the city council into approving a plan to expanding the 9-holes into a 18-hole public golf course, at public expense.  More recently, the original ranch subdivisions have voted to erect a wall around itself, creating a new gated community named \"Bell\\'s Country Club Village.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6u15qpll76m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.15264,33.9566]}},{"properties":{"name":"Peace Sign, switch to satellite view and zoom in.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://riceball.com\" href=\"http://riceball.com\">Wildgift</a>If you switch to satellite view and zoom in here, you will see a large Peace sign in the dirt.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6u15qmawsl8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.79796,35.30227]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pepe's","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://riceball.com\" href=\"http://riceball.com\">Wildgift</a>An old stand with a drive through!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6u15qbx6z1h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.1285,34.07843]}},{"properties":{"name":"Porky's","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://riceball.com\" href=\"http://riceball.com\">Wildgift</a>A pork themed restaurant.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6u15qlwwawh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.167786598,34.0223422048]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rear ended my new car!","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://riceball.com\" href=\"http://riceball.com\">Wildgift</a>I was just sitting there in my new, six month old truck, and a dude in his company delivery car hits me.

This is the original site of the Church of the Firestone, founded by Roger Mahoney in 1890.  This is not *the* Roger Mahoney, but a different person.  Mahoney was an Irish-Catholic immigrant who founded a pagan cult that worshipped fire.  As a sacrament, they consumed small amounts of flint and practiced flint-based rituals to summon the god of fire.  Every Friday night (which they called Fire-Day night), Mahoney would evangelize the local migrant workers about the sun, fire, light, warmth, or hell.  Afterward, the parishoners would have a ritual cooking of meat on the barbeque, and would eat together.  Though most of the members didn\\'t really believe in what Mahoney said, they stayed for the excellent grilled meats.  The flint was collected from a small mine located around half a mile from this site, to the south.  Over time, the flint mine operations became lucrative enough to sustain the church in relative opulence.  Mahoney became enamoured of creating spectacular fireshows during his sermons, using large metal pans of kerosene and alcohol, giving his church an exciting advatage over the rival Methodist and Episocopal churches.  Roger Mahoney eventually had some members create a chrome plated, propane flamethrower that would, on command, shoot long streams of blue and yellow flames above the pews.  The members were ecstatic, and the church grew, especially during the early parts of the Great Depression, when meat was expensive, Mahoney was rich, and the BBQ was plentiful.  It all ended when, one night, someone forgot to close the propane valve completely, and the next morning\\'s sermon resulted in the entire front of the church exploding into flames, killing fifteen people, including Mahoney.  Remaining members re-established the church in La Canada.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6u15qkm60pe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.10545,33.92508]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rose Hills","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://riceball.com\" href=\"http://riceball.com\">Wildgift</a>The cemetery that advertises itself with a red neon sign reading ROSE HILLS, visible for miles.
