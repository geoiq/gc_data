I had to wonder, is King Taco the monarch of this Kingdom, or is this the domain of another?\nThe B&amp;C had a pretty good texture, but the flavor was off. It was pasty, not creamy.  The cheese was not fully melted, but the combination was fine.  They provide a much needed container of sauce, which makes the burrito taste more like a taco.\nMaybe what this kingdom needs is a Magna Carta of beans, a more democratic system where the eaters can tell the rulers how to make the beans.

Taco Nazo specializes in fish tacos, but I got a B&amp;C.  White cheese, as is the new tradition out here, and a little pricey, but it was a big one.  The cheese wasn\\'t overpowering, either, just the way I like it.  It was runny, which is a plus for me, for some reason.  They also provide these baked chiles with salt and pepper, for free, and they probably helped boost the overall experience.  (Their fish tacos are really good, too.)\n\nThe only downside is that it\\'s  for a B&amp;C.
