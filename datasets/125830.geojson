Established in 1989, 885 acre (763 hectare) park is the largest green space in Vancouver.\nThis Park surrounds UBC with forests and beaches. Within minutes of entering the park we will find ourselves in another realm; this early logged forest has regenerated itself and is comprised of a rich mix of coniferous and deciduous trees. A dozen varieties of ferns carpet the forest floor. Underfoot, decades of accumulated mulch softens your steps. We’ll revel in the sounds of forest life as we explore its lush interior, looking for wildlife and all the things that hikers hope to find when they venture out.  \nSo come on out and enjoy the sunshine and fresh air in this oasis in the middle of the concrete jungle. After the hike, we will head to a local restaurant for some drinks and food. Most trails are gentle and offer visitors the opportunity of a quick getaway from the pace of the city.  \n   \"Where Singles &amp; Adventure Meet\"<a href=\"http://www.meetmarketadventures.com\">http://www.meetmarketadventures.com</a>\nTo reserve your spot please contact us directly by phone at 1-800-239-0542, via email: <a href=\"mailto:info@meetmarketadventures.com\">info@meetmarketadventures.com</a> or sign up through our website!\nDetails are subject to change without notice.\nTo reserve your spot please contact us:\n1-800-239-0542<a href=\"mailto:info@meetmarketadventures.com\">info@meetmarketadventures.com</a>","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6686384/BC/Vancouver/VancouverSingles-Urban-Hike/Throughout-Vancouver/","id":"a65clqxb6wcz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6686386/","title":"Sep  7, 2010: Vancouver Approach Her Anytime, Anywhere at Throughout Vancouver","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/30 21:28:33 -0400","original":"Mon Aug 30 21:28:32 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/08/30 21:28:32 -0400"},"description":"*this is not an MMA run event\nUNSURE OR NERVOUS TO APPROACH AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN\nShe may be standing in line at Starbucks, or walking down the street, maybe even with her girlfriends at a lounge.
