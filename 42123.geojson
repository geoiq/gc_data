Goya, a striking, yellow-eyed, red and white pit bull, came into my life around this time and busied herself with stalking marsh bunnies. I began my time in Charleston living downtown with a guy whose acquaintance with teenaged skinheads necessitated an immediate roommate change and I wound up living downtown with a botanist for a few months before landing at the Hotel Harbor View. The Post and Courier was my first job out of college and, as it entailed writing a ton of obits, it epitomized dues paying in journalism.

In a rare case of actually applying myself as an undergrad (thus resulting in my most lucid memories of this period of my life), I studied existentialism and 18th century British lit under real, no foolin\\' Oxford dons. There\\'s a lot that\\'s different about the Oxford experience from any studies in the US, but class sizes jump out as one of the most significant: one don and two students is a packed class at Keble. So it\\'s not as if you can hide behind the football player if you didn\\'t do the reading or gamble that the prof will call on one of the other 300 people in the stadium-sized classroom. It\\'s just you, the prof, maybe one other bloke and, hopefully, the umpteen pages of very in-depth thesis you wrote on Middlemarch, the 800 pages of which you only had a week to read and research. And which I attempted to do while squeezing in my first trip to Amsterdam (I swear, I was only there to see the Rembrandt and Van Gogh museums). Also, each class meets once a week.

Being landlocked and located in the Volunteer state, Memphis did not initially inspire confidence. It took a plate of Rendezvous ribs to obliterate my biases and I went on to join a dozen-odd other barbecue aficionados as a member of Pigs In Zen, which competed annually in the Memphis in May World Championship of Barbecue.\nGraham Parker once sang, \"Don\\'t bother with the local girls,\" but I didn\\'t listen and went ahead and bothered.

My parents stayed here through 2002. The house was built in 1915 as an Episcopal rectory and had a massive backyard that was the default location for every backyard football game in midtown Columbus. I attended Columbus High during this period, began a lifelong hobby of distance running and left a couple of gallons of sweat on the turf at Blue Hell, home of the CHS soccer team. I also played guitar -- badly -- for Maken Melodye (Chaucerian English for \"fuck\" -- ah, high school) with Cameron Lane, Erin Wamble, Dan Floyd and Tommy Tjoflat (later replaced by Colby Cardin). It was like the Summer of \\'69 except nobody got married. Notwithstanding a few decent Velvet Underground covers and a few decent originals (\"The Charleston Song\" and \"Fishman,\" I believe, were titles), we just, frankly, weren\\'t very good and were forced to concede the issue after a disastrously bad gig at a friend\\'s lakehouse. \nDuring the summer of \\'94 I made a second run at the \\'Bus\\' not-exactly-burgeoning music scene as lead (and I use that word loosely) guitarist for Radio Speed, which included Jon Lumpkin, Pat Knopf and Dan. Experience and alcohol calmed our nerves and we bashed out semi-competent covers of Neil Young, Johnny Thunders, the New York Dolls, T. Rex, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Pavement and Elvis Costello before a mostly appreciative audience at the Human Experience Theatre downtown as the opener for local heroes East Orange.

This study abroad trip was ostensibly centered on classes in magazine article writing and critical writing, but it was also liberally dosed with trips to the Italian and French rivieras, Rome, Milan and followed by a pan-European trek through Copenhagen, Netherlands, Prague, Munich, Switzerland, Chamonix and Paris. We saw \"Aida\" in a Roman coliseum and got drunk with the cast afterwards.

There had been some gnashing of teeth about when I would do what Jamie and all of her friends were long tired of waiting for me to do. Unbeknownst to me and well-knowst to everyone else, the one-year mark in Austin was my deadline, which I ... uh, missed. Bu-bu-but, I had a plan. Following a study abroad trip in Southeast Asia, I would fly Jamie out to Thailand for a week, whereupon I would bust out the hardware. (Ok, so I had to sell my car to finance the excursion, leaving me car-less ever since. All that makes me is one less dumbass paying .50 a gallon.)\nSo Jamie makes it to Bangkok, which was sort of a surprise to both of us. I mean, dating for three years is a strong statement and so is  moving from Memphis to Austin (although not as strong as moving to Texarkana, but, until such time as I have the incredible misfortune of having to put that fair burg on my map, we\\'ll let that one go). But boarding a plane for 20 hours to fly to a third-world Sin City that\\'s more sinful than Amsterdam and Vegas combined, well, that\\'s put-up-or-shut-up-type stuff.\nSo Jamie arrives and the next day we\\'re off to Rai Leh Bay to tour some temples, paddle kayaks along the Andaman coast and get our backs massaged into butter. I guess it was day 2 and my master plan was a day of paddling and snorkling before making our way over to a small island, Chicken Island, and propose at Sunset. \nProblem was, Jamie had an unforeseen aversion to open water paddling. Granted, this was open water paddling over an area that never got much deeper than two feet. But it <i>was</i> open water and after a few ridiculous minutes of me angrily paddling forward while she frantically paddled backward, I let it go. Try to picture the emotional arc here: a level of anxiety that wouldn\\'t be out of place on one\\'s first attempt at skydiving, followed by vein-bulging aggravation, followed by some serious resignation, as in, a family of black cats just crossed your path on Friday the 13th while you, glimpsing through your broken rear-view mirror, spot a mockingbird drop dead out of a tree. So yeah, I was feeling some pensiveness.\nEventually, we found a secluded beach with a nice view of the setting sun and I stammered my way through a speech that, inexplicably, I had never gotten around to rehearsing. (\"So you made this big jump to Austin with me and then leapt across the Pacific to join me here and, hey, speaking of leaps ...\" I have no idea what I actually said, but it was probably about that awful.) \nIn spite of all that, she accepted.

Jay bought the Bop Gun and a nervous pit bull named Seven who, at my urging, became convinced that a nation of cats lived underground on our property.

Growing up, we spent every summer on this island at a hourse our family owned for decades called Beachwater. That was also the case for my mother, whose ashes we spread off the northern tip of East Beach. \nMy brother and I used to go crabbing off the Sea Island pier, the East Beach Causeway and off the northern tip of Sea Island (I was going to say \"catch crabs,\" but the fact that the nearest prostitutes to this area are in Brunswick is probably not common knowledge). If the hauls were big enough, we\\'d sell some to the owner of the pier or to Gisco\\'s Seafood for 5 cents apiece and boil the rest. We oftened fished off the piers as well and, at the Sea Island pier, there were a couple of sea otters, Miss Piggy and, later, Beauty, who barked and did all kinds of tricks, like swimming the backstroke, to induce us to toss them some entrails. Ben and I learned to horseback ride here as well.\nOn our first vacation as a couple, I took Jamie down to the Georgia coast. We stayed in a primitive B\\'n\\'B on Sapelo Island for a few days and were regailed with plenty of Gullah and Geechee legends by Cornelia Bailey, the island\\'s historian, griot and all-around matriarch. This was the first time I took Jamie sea kayaking and, due to some close encounters of the gator kind, it came damned close to being her last such experience. After reaching an impasse at a gator-filled inlet, we walked the length o the beach back to the empty mansion once inhabited by tobacco magnate and Sapelo lord R.J. Reynolds, where we were prepared to spend the night on the marble porch. Fortunately, it was too dark to see the massive cockroaches that were crawling all over it. Even more fortunately, one of the island\\'s residents happened to be cruising the area in their truck and we flagged them down and got a ride back to the cottage. Their back window had a \"Gators\" sticker (as in the hated University of Florida football team) on the back window and we were almost too dehydrated and exhausted to note the irony. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gs7k7ip0zd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.366119,31.155233]}},{"properties":{"name":"The 'To","description":"Posted by Tommy2725 Franklin Boulevard, Sacramento, CaliforniaThrough several strange twists of fate following an increasingly desperate jobless summer of 2005, I landed at Intel as a senior financial analyst in August 2005 and set up in Sacramento.
