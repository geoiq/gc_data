The great bread is from a local bakery whose identity is her \"best-kept secret,\" says owner Brenda Lucas. The curried chicken salad with a touch of apricot preserves is a standout and is Lucas\\'s own favorite piled on a croissant with lettuce and mozzarella. The tuna salad is made only with Albacore and the nice addition of capers. Meats are lean and very thinly sliced, complemented beautifully by condiments like house-made cranberry-orange-pecan compote and sage cream cheese on the Pilgrim turkey sandwich (.25) and Cajun mayo and pepper jack cheese to spice up your roast beef (.25). The personal touch carries through in the form of three chocolate kisses that come with each sandwich. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g8k04dqew"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.10821,44.44616]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blakely Road, Colchester","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>The town of Colchester plans to build a sidewalk along Blakely Road and the Interstate 89 overpass, where the bike bridge is.

He knew enough not to change, but just to add to a list of sandwiches that have become classics, like the Purdy, an inspired combination of smoked turkey, bacon, smoked gouda, and red onion with veggies on your choice of Klinger\\'s bread (.43). The BLT and G, one of my favorite sandwich combos, comes with another of my favorites, guacamole, slathered all over it (.40). It\\'s only a slight stretch to call it, as Kramer does, \"pretty much a life-changing sandwich.\" Cobblestone\\'s surprise strong seller is the Donald DuPont, (named after the owner of the roofing company previously in the space): liverwurst served on Jewish rye, which Kramer says, is ordered largely by \"old men and attractive women.\" Go figure.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g8jofnwce"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.21847,44.47569]}},{"properties":{"name":"Derailment","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>Emergency hazmat crews work to secure a freight train after several cars flipped over in downtown Middlebury Monday afternoon.

Owner Ladislav Pancisin was pressing his sandwiches into warm submission before panini grills became as common as Quiznos around here. The menu is globally inspired and includes some uniquely tasty offerings, which do come with a wait at peak times. Highlights include the Cuban pork sandwich (.30) with roast pork tenderloin, tomato, pickles, and Swiss cheese and the Japanese tuna, unlike all other tuna salad and made with coarsely chopped, freshly grilled tuna, onions, pickles, and cheddar (.75). Vegetarians among others love the Jamaican avocado, which layers the buttery green slices with fresh basil and a hit of cayenne pepper (.50).

The sandwich menu is simple: their own very good thinly sliced smoked ham or turkey or imported Canadian smoked beef layered with veggies and a choice of sharp cheddar or Swiss cheese. The turkey is particularly good with their cranberry-orange relish and they also offer a BLT made with their own bacon (all .95). The focus here is the meat in the middle, as one might expect, but I recommend the Klinger\\'s bread options, not the soft, squishy alternatives they also offer.

Recently added sandwich ingredients include pesto, fresh mozzarella, and roasted red peppers, Martone says. \"We just keep adding more and more items. We must have at least 30 different types of sandwiches.\" Rolls are soft, but sturdy enough to handle the hefty fillings and, be forewarned, the sandwiches are really big. You can\\'t go wrong with a traditional Italian piled high with salami, capicola, and mortadella (.15/7.35) or the Vermonter with maple ham, maple turkey, and cheddar (.15/7.35). Martone himself is partial to a veggie option (pick any or all, from pickles to radishes to sprouts to hot peppers) with smoked gouda. \"I don\\'t get quite as groggy in the afternoon,\" he says. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g8jkxbqv5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.1095,44.49138]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paving along U.S. 7","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>Between the Winooski line and Rathe Road in Colchester is expected to get under way this summer.
