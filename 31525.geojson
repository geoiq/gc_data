With this luminous, glass building, there\\'s a small park area with lush grass, which is refreshing to walk on besides the harsh side walks we\\'re so use to. \nPrimarily the glass windows and the visually open space within the building was similar to the colossal, transparent box-like mall in San Francisco. This I could view from my hotel window. The sidewalks around it were clean, and I could see the mannequins posed through the vast window. At night, the hospital lights are left on, and resonate the familiar glow the glass box mall emanates.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97cq7fm5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1582431793,39.9474833225]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jenn - The Airplane","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/16thandLocustCluster_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/Walnutand13thAirplane.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/HicksandPinePuddle_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/BroadandPineStormClouds_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/17thandPineSkyline_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/Walnutand13thParkingGarage_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/Smelder&amp;17thWalway_2_.jpg\">There\\'s a boy I\\'ve dated off and on for years -- the off and on depending upon what zip code I happened to be in at the time. He\\'s always been there for me.\n\nI was in a small college town in MO, and I felt like I needed some direction, or at least a change. He talked with me, both about us and about Philadelphia. I decided to come out and visit him.\n\nWhen I stepped off the plane, I was shaking.  I called; he said he was on his way. I remember the clarity of vision, and how it wildly contrasted with the fog, and the  nerves, in my head. My mind was racing; I passed hundreds of exhausted, happy, irate, reunited, estranged, lonely, exhilarated people along the way, but did not spare them more than a glance, because I knew I wouldn\\'t find him there. Finally, I arrived at the baggage terminal. I watched people, feeling as though I had never been so nervous in my life. I cast around, looking for a place to perch myself and attempt to look comfortable. I remember the exact position I placed myself in; I remember the lights, so dark because of the stormy sky looking on yet so illuminated by the florescence and the people. I remember seeing people but not really \\'seeing\\' them, my eyes darting this way and that to catch sight of him.\n\nI remember when he finally came. I remember the exact, goofy grin on his face, the way he cut through people without meaning to (he\\'s a big guy). I remember the nervousness floating away, and though it was a dark, very stormy, rainy night, it felt as though the sky could not have been brighter. I remember the cold air, alarming yet soothing, once you got used to it, and ducking in the rain, laughing. The streets smelled like rain and muck; it could not have been a drearier night,  yet I remember feeling as though the world could not have been brighter... And by this, I knew I\\'d found home.\n\n***\n\nThe plane was the first thing I saw outside. It was a pretty powerful reminder of the journey. (13th and Walnut)\n\nThe parking garage reminded me simultaneously of the lights in the terminal, and the lights and ceiling structure of the garage we cut through. (13th and Walnut)\n\nThe picture of the woman crossing with the people approaching reminded me of the people who just seemed to keep pouring out of that baggage terminal from all directions, all walking my direction, and the struggle to try to spot him through all the crowds and the noise. (16th and Locust)\n\nThe skyline picture reminded me of how I could not resist looking up, even at the potential expense of walking into a wide assortment of objects... Directly. (17th and Pine)\n\nThe picture of the pretty walkway with the speed sign reminded me of the long, endless stretch of road ahead of us as we walked, and how pretty it was in its right. (17th and Smedlers)\n\nThe puddle and the storm clouds were clear references to the dark and the rain. My only regret about these pictures is that I could not take them later at night. (Hicks, Broad and Pine)\n\nThe end! ^_^<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97bhojdw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1604747772,39.9485032251]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kerry G","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a>all the fancy stores on walnut\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97dsapgu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1660966873,39.9495231126]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kylie- 13th and Locust","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a>I went on a hike on the island of Kaui in Hawaii with my family.

They\\'re everywhere and they bring about the urban area a sense of life. It\\'s a dichotomy between the life on the streets bustling with artificial lights from cars, crazy tourists vs. friendly bums. The palm trees stood tall with the occasional breeze bustling through. It was a resting point for the eyes when the streets below were too overwhelming. It enhanced the San Francisco urban experience--being another attribute and reason for why I would love to live there some day. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97gr6s7u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1617622375,39.9478452252]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trees &amp; Brick (Marlena)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a>the corner of 12th and pine.  has lots of trees and red brick building that doesn\\'t give as much of a city feel.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97ajxhbv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1612043381,39.9451638098]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tsveta","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/n782960136_1493560_442.jpg\">1228 Spruce StrNice, France, small street close to the touristic zone and the central part.

This park reminded me of a similar park in San Francisco that I was able to view from the King George IV hotel. It was spacious with lamp lights placed around the edges of the perimeter. There were benches where young hooligans with nothing better to do would hang out with their peers. It\\'s a nice space to hacky-sack. Like Washington Square, there was a nice green area where the grass was vibrant, and palm trees surrounded flower beds that were scattered throughout the park. I remember having a great sense of relief whenever I sat at that park even though it was fairly close to a busy intersection. Still, it encompassed a sense of serenity and light fun to watch the people walking by.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97da73f3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1521062851,39.9467595113]}},{"properties":{"name":"XPress FoodMart/SubWay shop: Meaghan Hartie","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/foodmart_subway2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/foodmart_subway1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> I remember one day, I went to this unfamiliar part of Staten Island, NY near Forest Ave and close to the P.S. 18 school. It was getting a little late while I was waiting for my ride to come pick me up from the front doors of the school when I started looking around. The area was filled with a mix of old homes and buildings along with a tall apartment building, stores crammed together and office buildings all surrounding the school. These two stores reminded me of the stores that were crammed together in the corner of two big buildings where there was also a Subway shop.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97dxfhe5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1650238037,39.944456425]}},{"properties":{"name":"alleway graffitti","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97bwafun"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1600241661,39.9457560332]}},{"properties":{"name":"elizabeth: apartment door","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/DSC01251.JPG\">It\\'s like a wrought iron representation of the rain forest...<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f972z23x5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1672554016,39.9483716256]}},{"properties":{"name":"elizabeth: around city hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/DSC01243.JPG\">We went to Cosat Rica when I was seven. One day, we walked through the rain forest, up a mountain. It was humid and the birds were screaming and the smell of sulfur was unbearable. When we reached the top, the trees had cleared and we looked out onto a huge volcano. The volcano looked more like a crater than any volcano I had ever seen. As we got closer, someone picked me up by my ankles and held me over the volcano. I screamed and breathed in a lungful of sulfur. I thought I was going to fall into the volcano for sure.\n\nWhen I ride my bike around city hall, at this very intersection, I\\'m alway feel the same as I did when I was hanging over the volcano. And the smell of exhaust could suffocate anyone. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97gidm3v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.164809227,39.9532735358]}},{"properties":{"name":"elizabeth: city hall subway entrance","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\" href=\"http://www.teach.boxwith.com/infoconcepts-fall07\">Infoconcepts</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/DSC01246.JPG\">This subway entrance has always reminded me of the volcano.

After discovering the first Mess Punkt (measuring points) on the sidewalks of the city, i began to collect photos of the various types of points as I found them. Obsessively, I scanned the ground for these, growing my collection as fast as I could, trying to assemble some kind of typology of the things. They were spiked through the cracks of the pavers, pavers of many different shapes and material... lines connecting dots. The sun would cast the faintest shadow from the low relief of the metal points. I remember plotting the points, thinking ahead to the time when I would remember them (as I am now) and plot a map of my wanderings in Berlin.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f97auhtac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.1473855972,39.9478616752]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/62804","metadata":null,"contact_name":"infoconcepts","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:infoconcepts","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/62804","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":31,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=62804,platial:user=infoconcepts","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":31525}
