An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).<b> Net migration rate (migrant(s)/1,000 population)</b>1Macau26.21.........<b>12</b><b>Australia</b><b>6.34</b>.........146Micronesia, Federated States of-21.04 • <b>Download this dataset</b>: <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2112.html\">CIA - The World Factbook</a><i>This KML file was generated by </i> <a href=\"http://www.kmlfactbook.org\"><b><i>kmlfactbook.org</i></b></a>","id":"11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[133.775,-25.2744]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[145.11,-40.82],[144.7,-40.76],[144.68,-41.22],[146.04,-43.5],[146.92,-43.62],[147.32,-42.85],[148.0,-43.23],[148.22,-40.85],[146.59,-41.19],[145.11,-40.82]]]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[142.51,-10.87],[141.59,-12.55],[141.94,-12.88],[141.58,-12.99],[141.43,-16.08],[140.49,-17.64],[139.26,-17.34],[135.46,-14.94],[135.92,-13.28],[136.46,-13.25],[136.98,-12.36],[136.56,-11.93],[136.04,-12.47],[135.67,-12.2],[135.91,-11.76],[135.23,-12.29],[131.98,-11.13],[132.75,-12.13],[130.58,-12.4],[129.37,-14.33],[129.94,-14.77],[129.73,-15.2],[128.53,-14.76],[128.01,-15.5],[128.17,-14.7],[127.42,-13.95],[126.86,-13.75],[126.29,-14.23],[126.02,-13.92],[126.04,-14.52],[125.64,-14.64],[125.61,-14.22],[125.14,-14.74],[125.43,-15.14],[124.83,-15.16],[125.18,-15.52],[124.45,-15.49],[124.4,-15.87],[124.73,-15.81],[124.59,-16.11],[124.43,-16.1],[124.4,-16.33],[124.9,-16.42],[124.24,-16.41],[123.96,-16.25],[123.89,-16.38],[123.73,-16.14],[123.57,-16.17],[123.92,-17.2],[123.6,-16.99],[123.58,-17.6],[122.92,-16.42],[122.17,-17.24],[122.35,-18.11],[121.03,-19.59],[116.71,-20.65],[114.15,-22.53],[114.02,-21.85],[113.39,-24.43],[114.22,-26.31],[113.47,-25.54],[113.86,-26.51],[113.22,-26.24],[114.89,-29.2],[115.74,-31.87],[115.71,-33.27],[114.99,-33.52],[115.01,-34.26],[117.93,-35.13],[120.0,-33.93],[123.54,-33.91],[124.28,-32.99],[125.97,-32.27],[131.15,-31.47],[134.18,-32.49],[135.51,-34.62],[135.11,-34.6],[135.95,-35.01],[137.77,-32.52],[137.95,-33.56],[137.44,-34.93],[136.83,-35.25],[137.74,-35.14],[138.1,-34.14],[138.51,-35.03],[138.09,-35.62],[139.36,-35.37],[139.1,-35.62],[139.67,-36.23],[139.08,-35.68],[139.82,-36.55],[139.81,-37.3],[141.57,-38.42],[143.54,-38.86],[144.93,-37.87],[144.9,-38.5],[145.45,-38.23],[146.39,-39.15],[146.22,-38.71],[147.76,-37.98],[149.97,-37.52],[150.16,-35.94],[153.05,-31.04],[153.63,-28.67],[153.03,-27.18],[153.18,-25.95],[150.87,-23.51],[150.64,-22.34],[149.66,-22.5],[148.78,-20.23],[146.28,-18.88],[145.32,-14.95],[144.51,-14.17],[143.78,-14.41],[142.51,-10.87]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jordan","description":"<img src=\"http://www.tryse.net/kmlfactbook/img/logo2.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"42\" alt=\"kmlfactbook.org\">Jordan<img src=\"http://www.tryse.net/kmlfactbook/flag/jo.gif\" height=\"30\">Net migration rate (migrant(s)/1,000 population)2008This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population).

rate (migrant(s)/1,000 population)2008This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).<b> Net migration rate (migrant(s)/1,000 population)</b>1Macau26.21.........<b>16</b><b>Botswana</b><b>5.41</b>.........146Micronesia, Federated States of-21.04 • <b>Download this dataset</b>: <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2112.html\">CIA - The World Factbook</a><i>This KML file was generated by </i> <a href=\"http://www.kmlfactbook.org\"><b><i>kmlfactbook.org</i></b></a>","id":"15"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24.6849,-22.3285]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[26.96,-23.75],[29.37,-22.19],[28.02,-21.57],[27.71,-20.51],[26.17,-19.53],[25.26,-17.8],[23.62,-18.49],[23.3,-18.0],[20.99,-18.32],[20.99,-22.0],[20.0,-22.01],[20.0,-24.77],[20.81,-25.88],[20.64,-26.83],[21.67,-26.86],[23.01,-25.3],[25.51,-25.68],[26.96,-23.75]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"South Africa","description":"<img src=\"http://www.tryse.net/kmlfactbook/img/logo2.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"42\" alt=\"kmlfactbook.org\">South Africa<img src=\"http://www.tryse.net/kmlfactbook/flag/sf.gif\" height=\"30\">Net migration rate (migrant(s)/1,000 population)2008This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population).
