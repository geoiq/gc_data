He showed me the brilliance in Matt\\'s drumming.  I was 14 at the time and fell in love with mudvayne. I loved everything about them. I admired the band\\'s thinking strategies and their approach to all of their albums.  Ozz Fest 2005 was my first time seeing Mudvayne. They just put out \"Lost and Found\" and again, that album brought out another dimension to Mudvayne.  The band has a bright future ahead of them because they remain so close as individuals and they dont let anything bring them down!  1 singer in two bands would never work out in any other average band!!  Chad Gray does an amazing job of keeping both Mudvayne and HELLYEAH strong.  Only true fans understand Mudvayne and understand why they do what they do and why every single album has different dimensions.  You have to be on the same thinking level as the band so when they say or do something, you can say, \"Oh, that makes sense!\"  I thank Jimbo Mcallister, my drum teacher when I was 14 years old, for introducing me to mudvayne because I now introduce MY students to Mudvayne. I know Jimbo would me proud of me now. Music is amazing. If everyone had the thought process like Mudvayne, this world would be much differnent.
