If there\\'s one restaurant here that I *must* visit anytime I\\'m here (and I\\'m here at least once a year), it\\'s this one. I get a hot \"lazy\" lobster roll in a hot dog bun and a dish of Almond Joy ice cream for dessert. But there\\'s plenty of other good food here, too (and strong martinis). \r\n\r\nProvincetown was really the first \"gay\" place I ever visited. I came up alone for a week in June of 1994 and stayed at a gay inn. I met a guy who also went to my alma mater, the aggressively hetero St. Lawrence University (well, I went there for two years before transferring), at a bar one night, and that led to some interesting fun. I ate well, enjoyed the sea air, and wrote one of my first chapters for Fodor\\'s Gay Guide to the USA. I was 23, and spending a week in a largely gay resort town was still a big novelty to me.\r\n\r\nNow I come back here regularly to update the Outer Cape chapter of Fodor\\'s Cape Cod, and I usually come in late April. There are few crowds now. Provincetown has changed a lot in the decade - became snazzier, more upscale, less avowedly gay but still very welcoming of everybody. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s still one of my favorite places - one of the relatively few places in the world I feel very much at home.

Owl Dr., Sarasota, FloridaThis is where my maternal grandparents lived from the 1960s until roughly the early 1980s. I spent a week here every school spring break as a kid.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it was the home of my grandmother and her fourth husband, but for all practical purposes, although he was not related to me by blood, I thought of him as my actual grandfather. \r\n\r\nBird Key was (and is to an even greater extent today) this ritzy, gated, planned island community off the coast of Sarasota. As a kid, I soaked up as much of the island\\'s exclusivity as I possibly could, latching on to its glamorous sense of entitlement and privilege as though I lived there. \r\n\r\nWe used to go to the Bird Key Yacht Club for many of our meals. My grandparents didn\\'t own a yacht, but that didn\\'t seem to matter much. I remember developing a taste for Vichyssoise soup and thinking this also connoted a sense of wealth and importance. Oddly, as much as I love food today, I don\\'t really care much for that particular soup.\r\n\r\nAs a kid, I hated to master new skills in front of other people - I didn\\'t like to appear as though I didn\\'t know how to do something. So when I was 8 years old, my fear was learning to ride a bike in front of the other kids in my neighborhood in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThat year when we visited my grandparents on Bird Key, my mom rented a bike, and she spent the week teaching me to ride it. I came returned home fully versed in the ins and outs of bicycling and avoided the plague of looking incompetent in front of my friends. That is my strongest memory related to Bird Key...that and the hundreds of little lizards that used to race up and down the screened-in porch...and the Vichyssoise. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zysyzddmx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.560453,27.312146]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, New York","description":"Posted by Onalongtaxiridebergen st., brooklyn, nyThis is where friends of mine at the time, Craig and Syl, had a house, and I lived off-and-on in their guest room at various times in 1995 and 1996<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zyt8l4hmx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.989916,40.686463]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bournemouth, England","description":"Posted by Onalongtaxiridebournemouth, englandThis is where I spent a random weekend, alone, in February 1989.
