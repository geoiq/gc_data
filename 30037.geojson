By 1924, Portland claimed the 3rd largest narrow gauge streetcar system in the nation. But the boom was over, and the Great Depression saw the replacement of trolleys with electric buses, and especially gasoline-buses.  \n\nWWII extended the life of Portland's trolleys briefly due to gasoline &amp;amp; rubber rationing, even seeing some older tracks being chipped out of the pavement, but by 1950 all city trolley lines were discontinued.  The cars were usually burned on the banks of the Willamette and their steel parts recycled.  In 1956 the Hawthorne Bridge was remodeled, without tracks, and in 1958 the last interurban trolley line (Oregon City) was discontinued.  However, remnants and hints of its existance survive today.\n\nThere is a decent amount of information and several troves of photos of Portland's historic trolley system on the internet (although it can be a bit scattered and disorganized at times).

His vision involved exercising common-user rights to the existing tracks across the Hawthorne Bridge and tracks owned by the Clackamas Southern RR in Oregon City. Carver applied for franchises in Portland &amp; Gladstone, while the backers of the Clackamas Southern applied for 1 in Oregon City.\n\nThe Portland franchise was granted in October &amp; Gladstone\\'s in November. The Oregon City franchise was granted in Jan. of 1914, but included a clause requiring transfers be made available to the PRL&amp;P Oregon City Interurban. Carver wouldn\\'t have it &amp; split from the Clackamas Southern group, which was sold to PRL&amp;P shortly afterwards anyway.\n\nUndaunted, Carver altered his route to head south out of Portland then east along the south bank of the Clackamas River through Milwuakie up to the Viola area. Tracks originating at SE 3rd &amp; Hawthorne wove through SE Portland, eventually running parallel to the SouthernPacific tracks out of town as far as, eventually, the new township of Carver.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a646kyqc027a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.654618025,45.5058055238]}},{"properties":{"name":"old Madison Street Bridge (1891-1910)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\">Tinzeroes</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/4c5a71105e2ae8e23709458a3ca2d759.jpg\">Built by the Mt.
