Flat tire in some highland desert like corner of Wyoming.  Couldn\\'t budge the lugnuts, literally bent 2 tire irons and the wheel was spinning under pressure, despite NOT BEING ON A JACK!  We piled all out luggage in the front of the bus and had one another sit in the driver\\'s seat in an attempt to offset this weight issue, no luck.  We decided to hitch it back many miles to some town.  The minivan family that stopped would only let one of us in (cautious).  When he got back with a can of WD-40 he told me of his adventures trying to catch road wandering cattle, to ride one, because there were NO CARS COMING.  After many hours of waiting, a park/forest ranger type guy came along, and called us a tow truck from over 100 miles away.  What a day.  Oh yeah, the tire shop said that the wheel had been mounted so tight with an air compressor that no human would really have ever been able to get that thing off. great.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kzdtwqvdnt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.164001,41.403198]}},{"properties":{"name":"Car stuck in the sand","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/832e8053152eb1907d1eb2dbd649d7b8.jpg\">pismo beach, caPismo Beach has a huge \"drive your car on the beach\" area, and so some locals who were showing us around really had to take us there, in their little mini pickup.

The footing has slightly sloping walls that attract a lot of novice climbers. The walls get steeper and steeper, going vertical for the top half.  Sometime in the early 90s, Pat, Mike, Kyle and myself brought some rope, our skateboards and a little courage down there one afternoon, determined to get on top and ride it.  The vertical climbing was scary, but not too hard, and soon 2 of us (kyle and mike stayed below) were realizing how lame the skating was.  There were decades worth of pigeon guano, gravel and accumulated dirt, and we hadn\\'t thought to bring a broom.  We tossed our boards down and started getting ready to descend, but the edge of that top plateau surface did this really sketchy thing, it had a rounded lip, a mellow, slow rolling edge, that was gritty and really pretty slippery.  The tought of sliding over the edge was too hard to shake.  This was a 30 foot drop, or more, onto a concrete ledge.  Pat and I decided that we\\'d just ask Mike and Kyle to go get us some help, to go to the fire department or something.  They just straight up refused!  There may have been some kinds of \"no climbing\" signs, i don\\'t recall, but it was obviously going to be a bit of trouble if the cops showed up.  After 15 minutes of shouting down our demands, and having them be ignored, we managed to get the attention of a passing jogger, and convinced her to send the fire department over, with a long ladder truck.  She happily obliged, and promptly returned to watch the rescue first hand.  The ladder truck drove out onto the grass, extended the ladder, sent up 2 escorts who walked us down.  There was a little bit of disappointment and a very mild scolding by the guy in charge, but overall, it was definately a worthwhile adventure, that only cost us about an hour or so from start to finish.  To this day, my family still doesn\\'t really believe me when i mention the story, I think my first delivery of it was done with such embarrassed laughter, that it seemed like a prank.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kzdtm1ii0p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.761145,45.586834]}},{"properties":{"name":"Foundational discrimination against aleprechaunists","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/news1_160.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1122 Nw Davis St # 228, Portland, ORI dare you to debunk the myth of Leprechauns at an art school.\nCheck out what happens if you try it at Portland\\'s branch of the art world\\'s chain art school.\n\nIn the classroom that day, Averill says one young woman was talking about her belief in energy layers and astral beings.\n\n\"I jokingly asked her if she believed in leprechauns. It turns out, she does. They live on another energy layer,\" Averill wrote in notes to himself later that day. \"In the interest of bringing my own view to the discussion, I began to ask her how she knew these things. Again I know all too well that people can be sensitive about their spiritual beliefs, so I was pretty much walking on glass as I did so.\"\n\nAverill says he wasn\\'t trying to disprove the other student\\'s religious beliefs, but \"to convince her not to insist that they were scientifically proven.\"\n\nThe student, apparently offended, complained to the teacher. Averill was called into a meeting that evening, he says, with the Art Institute\\'s dean of education, associate dean, and the dean of student affairs.\n\nAccording to Averill, he was told the meeting was \"because of my altercation with [the other student].\" Averill says he pointed out that he\\'d \"only offered a different viewpoint in a discussion that [my classmate] had started.\"\n\n\"They didn\\'t respond well,\" Averill told the Mercury. \"Their mantra was \\'no discussing religion in school,\\' which is fine except that I did not initiate the conversation, she had.\" Averill was suspended for four days, until a judicial hearing with the dean of student affairs.\n\nImmediately after the meeting with the deans, Averill found a classmate who had witnessed the initial conversation, and dragged him to the dean\\'s office. \"I thought I could clear this up, this is just a misunderstanding.\" (The witness did not respond to an inquiry from the Mercury.)\n\nBut the associate dean, Averill says, \"told me she didn\\'t want to hear from me again that day. So she reported it to the dean as rude and belligerent behavior.\"\n\nAt the judicial hearing, on November 17, Dean of Student Affairs Ron Engeldinger was more focused on the \"rude and belligerent behavior\" report from the associate dean, Averill says, than on the initial conversation about religion.\n\nThen Engeldinger, he says, brought up the fact that Averill had had some trouble with three instructors in October. \"The thing is, I had already had a meeting with the associate dean about [that]. We resolved the issue and I apologized to the professors involved.\" Averill was surprised that Engeldinger brought it up again.\n\n\"I expressed that I felt discriminated against as an atheist, and he informed me that mine was not a protected class of people,\" Averill says.\n\nAverill has since contacted the Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Freedom from Religion Foundation, based in the Midwest. He says the Freedom from Religion Foundation told him to seek legal counsel, and he expects the ACLU will respond to his inquiry within 60 days.\n\nAccording to an emailed letter from Engeldinger, Averill had violated the student conduct policy. The decision to dismiss Averill was \"not the result of a single action on your part, but a series of actions. I believe that, in several instances, your actions have been aggressive, demeaning, and threatening and that this demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate and unacceptable behavior,\" Engeldinger wrote.\n\nThe student who complained on November 8 wished to remain anonymous, but her account backs up Engeldinger\\'s letter. Her complaint was not the only reason he was sent into the Dean\\'s office. \"The teacher even told me that my complaint was the \\'last straw\\' as SEVERAL other complaints were stated before mine.\"\n\nHowever, she says she \"did not wish for him to be expelled or get in trouble and I had no idea that it was going to happen until after the fact.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, November 20, Averill met with the school\\'s president, Dr. Steven Goldman, to appeal his dismissal. \"He upheld the dean\\'s decision to throw me out,\" Averill says. \"He offered to re-admit me if I underwent—get this—psychiatric evaluation.\"\n\nGoldman declined to discuss specifics without Averill\\'s permission.\n\n\"I can say that we have never suspended or terminated or disciplined or otherwise troubled any student at any time about religious issues. It\\'s never even come up as an issue,\" says Goldman, who also teaches a comparative religion class at the school. Given the Art Institute\\'s liberal arts curriculum, there is no policy against discussing religion or philosophy, \"or any other subject as far as I know. We have an academic community in which people are free to explore ideas.\"\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kzdtidoy72"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.682452,45.524263]}},{"properties":{"name":"Held at knifepoint by a real psycho","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.asuwebdevil.com/images/issues/h7ak57i8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> fountain on the busmall, portlandSkateboarding downtown, about 14 years old, some guy runs up from behind me (all i see is him whipping open his butterfly knife and all my friends running away) gets me in a headlock, holds the knife to my throat.

She has to be home before midnight, so we pack up the car and start to drive out.  Uh oh, the big heavy serious gate seems to be closed across the road.  Get out, inspect it, yep, sure enough, we are locked in.  Now the big sign that says \"gate locked at sunset\" is staring us in the face.  I hadn\\'t even noticed that sign, guess I was in the mode of \"oh yeah, a bunch of rules, no problemo.\"  The gate is surrounded by huge sets of boulders that connect into thick nasty blackberry bushes.  We back up a quarter mile and find a potential work around, it\\'s a small shabby wood post fence blocking access to a huge pasture of tall grass, and maybe a secret way around the gate !?  We use the bumper to softly push the fence over, lay our floor mats over the barbed wire, and coast across into the hood high grass.  It really feels like swimming, thump, a few gopher holes give us occassional concern, but the hope of escape pushes us on.  Until we come to another fence, this one is 8\\' tall, and made of heavy guage stiff wire with very rigid square stock posts that are most likely set into concrete footings.  My little 1980\\'s japanese import was not giong to be a match for this fence.  We retreat in depression.  Her dad is expecting her home.  He\\'s an overprotective single Iranian AA guy who is going to flip out if he doesn\\'t at least get a phone call.  We drive back to the gate and walk to find a phone, any phone.  It\\'s a few miles to the first houses, all of them are dark, not counting the ambient blue flicker of the tubes.  No anwser after gradually banging harder and harder on the first few houses.  Starting to give up hope, were there stories of escaped convicts out here on the island? why wasn\\'t anyone coming to the door?  Finally a guy in his 50s lets us in to use the phone, we get back to the car and try to sleep, awaiting the gate keeper to set us free.  Suffice it to say that I\\'m more than a little upset that we were able to get locked in here, didn\\'t they do last call roundups before locking the gates?  I\\'m  expecting an apology, or at least some pity for the fact that this sweet young lady has to spend a miserable night car camping on a gravel road totally unprepared.

We had come up using the freight elevator, so we descided it\\'d be the best way to go down as well.  We re-boarded at 11:59, and during our descent, (what we can only assume was the result of an automated power switch set for midnight) the elevator stopped and the power went out.  Uh oh.  This is a pretty sealed up freight, no open railings to climb around, no open hatch in the ceiling.  We tried to pry the doors open, no luck.  We thought we\\'d give it some time, thought that it was a general power outage, not just the elevator.  Time goes by, no change, we are getting antsy, i have a cell phone with low battery warning.  I think through the short list of who would be willing to cross the east river to come rescue us.  Hartman! (maybe he even owed em a favor?) ...  Voice mail.

The power seems to have gone off.  My battery is about to die.\"  ...    He calls back a while later and says he\\'s on his way.  An hour or so later, he calls again to say that not only is the back door locked now, but he ripped his pants climbing the fence that is also now locked.  I try to convince him to talk his way past the night watchman, my phone dies, I don\\'t know how much he heard, or what he\\'s going to do.  We are now really at his mercy.  ...   Another hour or so goes by (at this point it\\'s hard to keep track) and we hear some people banging somewhere above us on the elevator shaft, yelling \"is someone in there? this is the NYPD!\".  We are shocked, startled, and relieved  After a short pause, we call back that we are down a bit lower, and that we are stuck.  A minute later the doors are being pried open with some kind of crowbar, and there are no less than 8 uniformed officers of the law waiting with their arms crossed for a good explanation ...
