At the center of Stanton Park is a statue of American Revolutionary War major general Nathanael Greene. The park was part of Pierre L'Enfant's original plan for the city.\n\n\n\nA children's playground is located in the western section of the park; a section in the eastern half is often used by dog walkers. The park is maintained by the National Park Service and as such, dogs are not allowed off leash.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama had an apartment near Stanton Park where he lived when going about his U.S. Senate duties in Washington.","privateaccess":0,"photocount":4,"ratingcount":"5","address":"Massachusetts Ave. and 3rd St.","lat":38.894606},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-76.9947867026987,38.894606],[-76.9949259959136,38.8931917322551],[-76.9953385225982,38.8918318140265],[-76.9960084295834,38.8905785062091],[-76.9969099727194,38.8894799727194],[-76.9980085062091,38.8885784295834],[-76.9992618140265,38.8879085225982],[-77.0006217322551,38.8874959959136],[-77.002036,38.8873567026987],[-77.0034502677449,38.8874959959136],[-77.0048101859735,38.8879085225982],[-77.0060634937909,38.8885784295834],[-77.0071620272806,38.8894799727194],[-77.0080635704166,38.8905785062091],[-77.0087334774018,38.8918318140265],[-77.0091460040864,38.8931917322551],[-77.0092852973013,38.894606],[-77.0091460040864,38.8960202677449],[-77.0087334774018,38.8973801859735],[-77.0080635704166,38.8986334937909],[-77.0071620272806,38.8997320272806],[-77.0060634937909,38.9006335704166],[-77.0048101859735,38.9013034774018],[-77.0034502677449,38.9017160040864],[-77.002036,38.9018552973013],[-77.0006217322551,38.9017160040864],[-76.9992618140265,38.9013034774018],[-76.9980085062091,38.9006335704166],[-76.9969099727194,38.8997320272806],[-76.9960084295834,38.8986334937909],[-76.9953385225982,38.8973801859735],[-76.9949259959136,38.8960202677449],[-76.9947867026987,38.894606]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stead Park","city":"Washington","5stars":1,"statecode":"DC","4stars":1,"1star":0,"3stars":1,"2stars":0,"commentcount":3,"id":"a63py66derw0","lng":-77.038491,"description":"Separate play space for 2-5 year olds (tot lot).
